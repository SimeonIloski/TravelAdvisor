Once known as "Enchalon" -Eel, Struga has a population of approximetly 15 000 inhabitants. It has been known since the time of the Ilirs, and many old writers of traveling guides have noted that Struga was a very vivid city, with developed trade, great markets and the houses of the wealthy citizens were always beautiful and decorative. That is why the well-known saying: "There is no other place like Struga" exists since then. Except the  Ohrid lake in Struga there is a river called Crn Drim which flows gently through the town, as it does not want to disturb the visitors walking along its banks, thrilled by its crystal clear waters. In the evening when many lights are turned on, the river has even a better view by the reflection of light from its waters.', N'http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/struga.nspx')
